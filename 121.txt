FOURCC is short for "four character code" - an identifier for a video codec, compression format, color or pixel format used in media files.

A character in this context is a 1 byte/8 bit value, thus a FOURCC always takes up exatly 32 bits/4 bytes in a file.

Another way to write FOURCC is 4CC (4 as in "four" character code).

The four characters in a FOURCC is generally limited to be within the human readable characters in the ASCII table. Because of this it is easy to convey and communicate what the FOURCCs are within a media file.

AVI files is the most widespread, or the first widely used media file format, to use FOURCC identifiers for the codecs used to compress the various video/audio streams within the files

Some of the more well known FOURCCs include "DIVX", "XVID", "H264", "DX50". But these are just a few of the hundreds in use.
